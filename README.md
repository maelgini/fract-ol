# FRACT-OL
It’s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!
You will use the school’s graphical library, the MiniLibX. This library was developed
internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal
with keyboard and mouse events.
This will be an opportunity for you to become familiar with the MiniLibX library, dis-
cover or use the mathematical concept of complex numbers, explore computer graphics
optimization, and practice event handling.
